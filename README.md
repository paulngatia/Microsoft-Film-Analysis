# Microsoft Film Analysis
## Overview
Microsoft has given us the duty of evaluating the state of the film business before it jumps on the bandwagon, due to the surge in original film production in giant companies. To arrive at findings, I examined the most popular genres and those with high audience votes, as well as the profitability of specific genres by looking at their return on investment and previewing the month of release.

## 1. Business Problem
Choosing how to make original video content that will differentiate Microsoft from competitors and draw and keep viewers could provide a business challenge. Microsoft must set itself apart from the competition and provide engaging content that appeals to viewers in order to take the lead in the market, since well-known companies like Sony and Disney already produce excellent unique content. This can be done by;

- Making large investments in marketing, sales, and talent acquisition,
- Developing a thorough awareness of the tastes and trends of the audience
Making informed decisions about monetization that strike a balance between the expenses of producing new content and income sources like advertising or subscriptions;Â 
- Acquiring a thorough awareness of audience patterns and preferences.

Three main criteria served as the foundation for my analysis.

- Which month of the year is best for a movie's release?
- How do revenues and production costs relate to each other?
- What kinds of genres are the most well-liked?

## 2. Data Understanding
The datasets used in this analysis were obtained from Box Office Mojo, The Numbers, and TMDB, three movie websites.

Five columns make up the first dataset, bom.movie_gross.csv, which includes the release year, studios, domestic and international revenue, and movie titles.

The names, release dates, and financial details of released movies, including production budget and global profit, are all included in the second dataset, tn.movie_budgets.csv. The ROI is the dataset's main variable, and the financial data columns were the main factor in the dataset's selection.

The genre codes, original language of the films, original movie titles, popularity metrics, release dates, and vote information are all included in the third dataset, tmdb.movies.csv. In order to determine which genres are more popular, I utilized this dataset to match genre codes to genre names that I found on the same website.

## 3. Approaches
I removed unnecessary data columns and collected dependable information from dependable sources. I substituted a value of 0 for any missing data. In order to find patterns and significant elements that go into making a good movie, I also made sure that any information I used came from reliable sources and employed both descriptive statistics and visual aids. This approach worked well for researching industry patterns and finding traits that high-grossing films had in common, allowing me to make informed recommendations.
