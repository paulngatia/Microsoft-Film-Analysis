## Microsoft Film Analysis
### Overview
Microsoft has given us the duty of evaluating the state of the film business before it jumps on the bandwagon, due to the surge in original film production in giant companies. To arrive at findings, I examined the most popular genres and those with high audience votes, as well as the profitability of specific genres by looking at their return on investment and previewing the month of release.

### Business Problem
Choosing how to make original video content that will differentiate Microsoft from competitors and draw and keep viewers could provide a business challenge. Microsoft must set itself apart from the competition and provide engaging content that appeals to viewers in order to take the lead in the market, since well-known companies like Sony and Disney already produce excellent unique content. This can be done by;

- Making large investments in marketing, sales, and talent acquisition,
- Developing a thorough awareness of the tastes and trends of the audience
Making informed decisions about monetization that strike a balance between the expenses of producing new content and income sources like advertising or subscriptions;Â 
- Acquiring a thorough awareness of audience patterns and preferences.

Three main criteria served as the foundation for my analysis.

- Which month of the year is best for a movie's release?
- How do revenues and production costs relate to each other?
- What kinds of genres are the most well-liked?
